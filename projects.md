All project outlines are listed below.

Projects are to be submitted on Slate by the end of class on the due date specified.

Rubrics, grades, and feedback are provided via Slate. 

If you have any questions/concerns about the projects or subsequent feedback, please get in touch.

Your PAL is available to help you with technical issues, such as code and design, but cannot give definitive answers about the assignment requirements—please direct those questions to Ryan.

## Project 1

**Due week of:** Feb 7    
**Weight:** 30% of your course grade

### Simple Dynamic Data Web Page

We will develop some simple ways to take input from external sources such as the time, working with variables, animating content and creating random interactions. Your task is to create a dynamic page that Javascript writes into after the page has loaded. Your content can be animated, textual, graphical or can be a mixture of all. It can require user input or just write directly in.

## Project 2

**Due week of:** Mar 14    
**Weight:** 30% of your course grade

### Two Dynamic Feature Web Page

Developing your skills from project 1. Your task is to take two of the features from the code we have covered in class and create a simple web page/ web app (it should have one primary goal) using two of the in-class examples and merging them, or finding other dynamic data/features on your own. Again, you are simply finding a use case for the page based on code we have already created in class. You will custom theme the design of your page and demonstrate it working.

**Due week of:** Apr 18    
**Weight:** 30% of your course grade

## Project 4

**Due week of:** Apr 18    
**Weight:** 10% of your course grade

### Documentation

This documentation will be delivered alongside the final project (project 3). Identify a suitable project from the list, then develop Persona’s (identifying goals and needs). Develop this further into Scenario’s (user’s experience, where they are located and how they will use the App). Also create Site Maps and Ethnographic (observation) study. Develop a flow chart of the user tasks that the App will help the user to achieve. Prototype your design of the design.
